# Lung Spatial Distribution

Voxel-based approach to study the relation of primary lung tumor location and survival of NSCLC patients.

This project is part of the SAKK 16-00 subproject on radiomics based outcome modelling and funded by Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF (310030_173303).


## Aim
Development of grid based features to investigate on the anatomical location of primary tumors in the lung. A mapping approach via deformable image registration based on minimizing single-lung contours to a standard lung anatomy is performed. 

## Methodology
Creation of frequency weighted cumulative status maps.
